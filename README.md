## Case Study Details
Bellabeat is a high-tech company founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur that specialized in health-focused smart products. Their smart products include an app, fitness tracker, wellness watch,  and water bottle.  Urška has tasked us to analyze data from non-Bellabeat smart devices to gain insight on how consumers are using their devices and how that information can be used to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Business Task
Analyze Fitbit data to gain insight on consumer use and help guide marketing strategy.

Stakeholders: Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, executive team members, Bellabeat marketing analytics team.

## The Data

The dataset used in this case study was generated by 30 respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 3, 2016 and May 12, 2016. The users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

## Preparation
- Convert Id into character datatype from numeric because when using ggplot, Id will display as scientific notation
```
daily_activity$Id <- as.character(as.numeric(daily_activity$Id))
```
- Inconsistent unique users
DailyActivity_merged.csv has 33 unique user Ids
WeightLog_merged.csv has 8 unique user Ids
SleepDay_merged.csv has 24 unique user Ids
```
> length(unique(daily_activity$Id))
[1] 33
> length(unique(weight_log$Id))
[1] 8
> length(unique(sleep_day$Id))
[1] 24
```
- Add a DayOfWeek column to analyze activity per day of the week
```
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% mutate( DayofWeek = weekdays(as.Date(ActivityDate, "%m/%d/%Y")))
```

## Recommendations
- Reminders to be active after so many minutes of sedentary activity
- Sleep reminders for certain time
- Not enough data around weight since the logging was manual. Is there an opportuntity for smart scales?  Or have a reminder to input weight manually for tracking.
